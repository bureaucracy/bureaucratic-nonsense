# Interviewing process and general expectations

## Things to bring

Bring a laptop if possible. Preload any portfolio work you might want to demo to the interviewers. They may also ask you to code something and you can ask if they will let you use your laptop - there is a good chance they will allow it. Make sure all sites are preloaded and cached in case you can't connect to their wifi.

Bring your phone. Make sure there's a data plan on it. If you end up not being able to connect to their wifi, you need to be ready to share the data on your phone to connect online.

## First pass phone screen

This is never a technical screen. It is mainly a recruiter just having a short conversation about your relevant experience and background. Keep it short and to the point, but also ask questions about what the technical interview process is like and any high level questions about the company. You may be able to get some additional information about the technical interview that could help you filter what you need to prepare next. Avoid talking about salary or whether they support relocation or are remote-friendly. That will come later.

## Second pass technical screen

This could be a take-home coding project, this could be over a realtime shared coding environment or it could be on video. All mechanisms more or less work the same way.

This is just to assess basic knowledge of something like data structures, JavaScript, CSS, whatever your specialty is

## Onsite

### Technical

They are assessing the following things:

1. Whether you read the problem and verified that you had all the necessary information required in order to code the solution. Usually an online coding environment or video will have a more ambiguous problem where you will need additional information before you can start. Do not start coding right away. Ask questions and ensure you and the interviewer both understand the requirements.

2. Write the requirements down as if they were test cases you would write for the solution. If you work through this method, you can code the function and explain the process to the interviewer in an ordered fashion that makes sense.

3. Always break up the solution into two parts - the less elegant solution and the more elegant solution. Never jump directly to the elegant solution. The idea is to create a narrative of a problem solving situation - as if you were teaching this to someone. During points where you might get stuck or are unsure, it is completely okay to ask for feedback on your solution. This is where they will want to see your ability to handle vague problems with team members in a collaborative way.

4. Write down everything you solve on the whiteboard (or document) as you go through it. Do not write the final result only.

### Non-technical / communication

These questions usually involve situational questions such as how you would work with difficult team members, difficult situations, real-world communication problems and solutions, etc.

If you have examples from previous work experience that match the scenarios they provide, then use that to provide an understanding of how to resolve conflict and maintain team "equilibrium". Never talk negatively of previous work experience, even if previous employers were terrible.

This is also where you can listen to what the interviewers say. If you can get a good idea of what their interests are and where you can get them to open up about themselves, this is where you can leave a positive impression.
