The bureaucratic system of interviewing and/or studying for a set of new things can be frustrating but is a solvable problem.

## Studying Tips

Focus on the AFM model - Acknowledge, Focus and Mentor.

### Acknowledge

Nothing is personal. Even a rejection isn't personal. Understand the system, understand the pathways that move all these problems into a similar problem space. All these things are related. Don't give up because you feel overwhelmed. Schedule regular intervals of learning and studying even when you don't need to. That's the best time. Make time to study with others of varying skill levels. Ensure everyone has a good understanding and empathy of each other's communication gaps. Chill.

### Focus

Start meditating regularly. Meditate after studying if possible. Repeat problems to yourself and to others (who have context) in work and non-work situations where these patterns of problems might reappear. Because they reappear everywhere. We all live in a universe with the same rules.

### Mentor

Take what you learn, how you learn, and understand how you communicate with others. Maybe what you think you are projecting to others isn't what they actually experience. Learn to see the difference of those two worlds and try to get closer to merging them into more of a middleground. Learn to understand how others might misinterpret or misunderstand what you are saying and learn to speak in a mental voice other than your own voice when necessary.

## Practice, practice, practice

Practice not only by working on the same problems over and over but understand the overall pattern and how you could apply it in problems outside of coding challenges and/or restricted problem sets.
